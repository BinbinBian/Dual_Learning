The opening of the domestic agricultural markets to foreign producers has been an unfortunate consequence of the trade imbalance in the industrial sector farmers are being penalized for industry &apos;s exports government subsidies and price stabilization programs should be subject to a systematic and periodic review to ensure that the programs are really helping the farmer and not just allowing a few to get rich without producing anything if a program is not functioning properly , then those financial resources questions now .
